# ReD-DeLiVeR
The ReD-DeLiVeR code is an updated version of the DeLiVeR code, designed to compute decay widths for light vector mediators, including several hadronic channels. The code can now be used to compute relic abundances, process rates, and thermal targets given a user-defined dark matter candidate.
